# Deep Chimpact Competition Benchmark Code

This repo contains code to port a trained depth estimation model to ONNX for MATLAB.

When the benchmark for the [Deep Chimpact: Depth Estimation for Wildlife Conservation](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/82/competition-wildlife-video-depth-estimation/page/390/) competition sponsored by MathWorks is made available, the code will be shared in this repo.
